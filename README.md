# Module 9A - Build Your First React Component

## Description

This is a React app created using Vite that renders a UserProfile component. The component includes a name, bio, and image styled with inline CSS.

## What I Learned

- How to set up a React project using Vite
- How to write and structure a functional React component
- How to use JSX and inline styles
- How to render a component in App.jsx

## Challenges

Briefly describe any errors, bugs, or confusion you encountered and how you solved it.
One error that I encountered was the name heading did not appear upon rendering. To fixed this, I explicitly set the color of the heading to black.

## Screenshot

Add a screenshot of your rendered component (you can drag and drop it here if using GitHub web interface).
